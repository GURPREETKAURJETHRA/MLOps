# **MACHINE LEARNING OPERATIONS (MLOPS)**

**Day1 of 66DaysOfMLOps**
- **Experiment Tracking & MLflow**: Experiment tracking is the process of keeping track of all the relevant information from an ML experiment, which includes source code, environment, data, model, hyperparameters, metrics, etc. MLflow is an open source platform for the machine learning lifecycle. It's also a python package that can be installed with pip and it contains four main modules: Tracking, Models, Model Registry & Projects. I have been learning and experimenting MLOps from **MLOpsZoomcamp**. Today, I have learned MLOps, MLOps Maturity Level, Why we need MLOps, Experiment Tracking Introduction & MLflow and few more topics related to the same. I have presented the implementation of Tracking using MLflow here in the snapshot. I hope you will gain some insights and you will also spend some time learning the topics from the course mentioned below. Excited about the days ahead !!

**Day2 of 66DaysOfMLOps**
- **MLflow**: The Model Registry component is a centralized model store, set of APIs, and a UI, to collaboratively manage the full lifecycle of an MLflow Model. It provides Model lineage, Model versioning, Stage transitions & Annotations. A client of an MLflow Tracking Server creates and manages experiments and runs.  I have been learning and experimenting MLOps from **MLOpsZoomcamp**. I have learned about Experiment Tracking and Model Management, Model Registry, MLflow Client, MLOps Workflow Orchestration, and a few more topics related to the same from here. I have presented the implementation of Model Training here in the snapshot. I hope you will gain some insights and spend some time learning the topics from the course mentioned below. Excited about the days ahead.
